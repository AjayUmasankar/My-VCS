Subset 0
25th September
5AM
Starting reading assignment spec
6AM
Watched Atlassian Git video and began coding up init and add.
This code was based on my solution to the lab08 snapshot task and the sample solution.
Finished coding init and add at 6:40
9AM
Finished subset0 all except subset0_8 test.
Lots of time wasted missing out on \n's randomly.
Lots of time used on creating the code for appropriate error display.
10AM
Changed code to commit only when the index differs from previous snapshot.
Other error messages popped while trying to fix this.
Most of the time spent refactoring code.

Subset 1
11PM - 3AM
Started working on subset 1
11.21 - finished and autotested commit -a with no errors
26th September

Mostly spent time refactoring and thinking about how to make code neater.
Finished all tests for commit -a option and all rm options. 
The errors still feel a bit arbitrary/wierd, but maybe this is because I haven't really used the reference implementation. 
Refactored my commit function, remove functions and others to improve readability and reduce code size. 

27th September
3.21am - 4.20AM
Started working on subset 1 status. Finished status tests for status at 4.20 am
4.40am - 4.45am
started fixing code to pass final subset 1 test (1_18).
All subset 0 and subset 1 tests passsed - 4.45am

Subset 2
7.30AM - 8:40am
Starting implementing branches in subset 2. 2041 autotest legit subset2_17 passed 
Changing code around and impplementing new helper functions to prepare for branch changing (checkout) 
11:30PM - 28th September 2:00AM
Worked on checkout mainly, all tests up and including to subset2_20 are working
Changed commit number to be tracked globally instead of relatively to branches.
3AM-5:00AM
subset2_21 working, spent time mostly attempting to mirror the outputs of tests.
subset2_22-23 finished too. 
Mostly dealing with edge cases involving errors and I had to change the way information was stored in my .legit repo. (e.g. introducing a commitNum file and currentBranch file)

29th September
12:00AM - 12:50AM
subset2_24 working (checkout with work that would be overwritten), fixed get_status method to be more accurate. Spent time just trying different conditions and experimenting when exactly the error message is printed out.
1AM - 1.30AM
Started working on a simple merge but decicded to leave it to later because finding a common snapshot would take some time.

1st October
2AM
Started on tests and started using reference implementation (via the test_legit.pl) to ensure there werent any problems with already implemented functions (everything except merge)

Testing:
	5. rm a a, where a exists
	6. commit -a a a a and commit -a -m a a a and commit -a -m
			. commit a a -m   
			. commit a a -a
	7. add filename criteria
	8. all or nothing with add_files ??
		if add a b and only a exists what happens

our @commands = ("init", "rm", "log", "show", "add", "commit", "status", "branch", "checkout", "merge");




./test_legit.pl always failed to initialize a legit repo unless the test00.sh had only one line which was legit.pl init..??






subset1_13:
b is in current dir, but has just been added to index
previous commit doesnt have b

status edge case:
if file is in all previous snapshots except most recent snapshot
and also file is in current directory

You should match the output streams used by the reference implementation. It writes error messages to stderr, so should you in legit.pl.
You should match the exit status used by the reference implementation. It exits with status 1 after an error, so should you in legit.pl.
